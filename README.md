# üöÄ FastAPI Application

Welcome to the **FastAPI Application**! This project leverages the power of FastAPI to build high-performance APIs with an organized project structure for scalability and maintainability. Below is an overview of the key components and directory structure.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

Here's a breakdown of the directories and their purposes:

- ### `app` 
  - Holds the core of the API service logic and orchestrates different components of the project.
  
- ### `main` 
  - The **API Entry Point**. This file launches the FastAPI app, initializing all routes and configurations.

- ### `api`
  - Houses all the **API Endpoints** and manages the request and response flows. It routes requests to the appropriate business logic.

- ### `core`
  - Contains essential components such as **settings** and **logging** configurations, handling global settings and setup that affect the entire app.

- ### `crud`
  - Provides **Database CRUD Operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete), ensuring modular database logic for data manipulation.

- ### `db`
  - Manages **database connections** and configurations, serving as the backbone for all data interactions.

- ### `models`
  - Defines the **Database Models** representing data schemas and tables, mapping the database structure into Python objects.

- ### `utils`
  - Contains **Utility Functions and Classes**. These are helpful tools used across various parts of the app, enhancing reusability and efficiency.
